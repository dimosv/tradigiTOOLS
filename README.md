\### Introduction



Tradigitools is a helpful plugin for Maya and now Cinema 4D that promotes a more traditional workflow for animation with digital tools.  It helps set keys and breakdowns, and has numerous workflow tools which were designed to make an animator's life easier.



It has been used extensively by professionals and studios around the world, and by many students of animation schools.



We are open sourcing the plugin in the hopes that it will gain a life of its own and continue to be used by animators, both hobbyist and professional, all over the world.



The source is released under the BSD2 license.  If you use the source for anything, we'd appreciate an email at info@circusink.com (and a link to your project!).





\### Latest Update

We're trying to rebuild the tools in a more flexible way as script(s) to help future-proof the toolset and make animators lives more simple.



\### Cinema 4D



This open source release also includes the Cinema 4D Python plugin.  Please see the cinema4D folder for instructions on installation.  If you're familiar with the Maya version, the Cinema 4D version should be right up your alley.  Thank Bret Bays for his amazing contribution.

Thank you to all the contributors that helped and keep helping to make these tools a great resource for artists and studios all over the world.
