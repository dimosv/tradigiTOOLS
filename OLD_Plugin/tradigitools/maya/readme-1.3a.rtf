\cf0 \
If you do not have one of the above specified versions of Maya the plugin may fail to load.  
\f2\i\b Only the above version is supported
\f1\i0\b0 .  To download updates, please visit the Autodesk website:\
\
http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/index?siteID=123112&id=2334435&linkID=9242259\
\
\

\f0\b INSTALLATION:\
\

\f1\b0 1) Close any open instances of Maya.\
\
2) If you are upgrading from a previous version of tradigiTOOLS, please back up your tradigiTOOLS.lic license file and uninstall the old version before running the new installer.\
\
3) On Windows and OSX, run the setup installation program and follow the instructions.\
\
4) Launch Maya and open the Plug-in Manager (Window -> Settings/Preferences/Plug-in Manager).\
\
5) In the plug-in manager, navigate to the tradigiTOOLS installation directory and load (and auto-load) the version of the tradigiTOOLS that corresponds to the version of Maya in use.\
\
6) A new menu item named "FUNhouse" will be displayed.  Select FUNhouse -> tradigiTOOLS to launch the tradigiTOOLS UI.\
\
Tip: A shelf icon can be created by holding Control+Shift keys and selecting the tradigiTOOLS menu item.\
\
\

\f0\b UPDATE HISTORY:\
\
v1.3a\
\

\f1\b0 1) Support for Maya 2013 SP2, 2013 Extension SP2, and 2014.\

\f0\b \
\
v1.3\
\

\f1\b0 1) Support for Maya 2012.\
\
2) Improved docking support for the tradigiTOOLS interface. Flickering should be fixed, and the Dock Control will not overlap other parts of the interface when initially docked in Maya 2012.\
\
3) Added a quick button for Auto Tangents.  It works the same as the other tangent buttons.\
\
4) When starting Maya and re-opening tradigiTOOLS, the global tangent type button now respects the user preferences instead of defaulting to "spline".\
\
5) Shot Mask is off by default when ANIMBlasting.  This has been requested a lot, so there you go! To enable it, turn on the setting in the ANIMBlast tab.\
\
\

\f0\b v1.25\
\

\f1\b0 1) Support for Maya 2011 Hotfix 3. Please note that versions of Maya 2011 that prior to Hotfix 3 ARE NOT SUPPORTED. Please update to Hotfix 3, as it fixes a number of critical issues.
\f0\b \
\

\f1\b0 2) Added support for docking the tradigiTOOLS interface.
\f0\b \
\
\
v1.21\
\

\f1\b0 1) Preliminary support for Maya 2009 (Windows 32, Windows 64, Mac OS X).\
\
\

\f0\b v1.20\

\f1\b0 \
1) Added support for Blend nodes\
\
2) Added support for Character Sets\
\
3) Parenting to the Camera is now supported for the shotmask\
\
4) WINDOWS ONLY: 64-bit support for Maya64 on XP64 & Vista64\
\
5) MAC ONLY: Maya 8.5 and Maya 2008 plug-ins are now Universal Binaries.\

\f0\b \
\
v1.11\
\

\f1\b0 1) A shotmask can be successfully created for all of the "Fit Resolution Gate" types (Horizontal, Vertical, Fill and Overscan).
\f0\b \
\

\f1\b0 2) Shotmask details can now be stored with the scene.  tradigiTOOLS will automatically update when a scene is loaded with saved details.\
\
3) A "Delete All" button was added to the shot mask creation.  Using it will delete both the shotmask and the stored shotmask details.
\f0\b \
\

\f1\b0 4) An ANIMBlast button was added to Quick Buttons section.\
\
5) Scaling for the shotmask text is now available.  Scaling can be accomplished in the X and Y directions independently.\
\
6) Fixed a Key/Breakdown issue that could potentially set a key that was a copy of the previously set key.\
\
7) Fixed a clipping plane limitation that could potentially keep the shotmask from being rendered.\
\
\

\f0\b v1.01
\f1\b0 \
\
1) Original Release\
\
\

\f0\b KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
\f1\b0 \
\
1) The shot mask may not display correctly if the camera's Lens Squeeze Ratio is not equal to 1.\
\
2) ANIMBlast will not dynamically update the shot mask if the camera's focal length has been animated over the course of a shot.\
\
3) ANIMBlast may playblast to the wrong size on a fresh install of Maya.  Creating a single regular playblast should remedy this on all subsequent ANIMBlasts.\
\
4) The text on the shot mask may display as blocks on a fresh install of Maya.  One time creation of text should solve this problem (Create -> Text).\
\
5) Parenting objects to the camera may cause the shotmask to fail.  Parent constraining can be used as an alternative.\
\
6) Some Maya 2009-specific features, like stereoscopic cameras, are not supported and may cause issues if used with tradigiTOOLS.\
